TODO: mvn surefire plugin should be included and set up so that only fork will be used for tests; 
      This may be the main reason both nifi controller and processor pass the tests in eclipse, but not in mvn since the Esper instance will shared for both tests and @Before and @After seem to be ignored. 

Not clear so far: evtl. use ' $ mvn clean install -U ' to update subprojects if some changes has been done;
